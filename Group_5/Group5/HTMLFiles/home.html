              "His photography practice is about interaction, frailty, overflow.
              He captures the moments of nothingness, the unexpected as much as
              the predictable, the blooming as much as the outbreak, the
              imagination as much as the ordinariness."

              backdrop and represent myself as a part of that landscape. With
              this act, I am building my own identity through the entourage or
              the part of the world where I live, or where I feel I can call
              home. My bio has described me as nomadic so maybe this is also a
              need of addressing the process of constant relocation.Another
              preoccupation I have in mind is the fact that flora as we know it,
              is coming to be endangered. I think that in my work, aesthetics
              bind with anthropology in order to register fragments of my
              personal and social memory."

            <h1>Joachim Schmeisser</h1>
            <p>
              For years, Joachim Schmeisser has been photographing the last
              giants of Africa at close range, creating exceptionally intimate
              portraits of species threatened with extinction. In his series
              "The Last Of Their Kind" he focuses on the beauty of creation and
              its fragile transience. These striking images are timeless works
              that can be interpreted on different levels: as depictions of a
              distant past or as iconic memories in a not too distant future in
              which we can only admire these majestic creatures in zoos. They
              are both an homage and a final warning - visual revelations that
              sharpen our clouded view of nature in all its infinite complexity
              as well as recognizing what treasures we might irretrievably lose.
